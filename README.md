Clone the repo to your src folder in your project directory

Open the repo folder in a terminal and run "go build" to build

Run "go run main.go" to start the server

Access the server via localhost:8080

Endpoints are localhost:8080/, localhost:8080/hello, localhost:8080/form.html, and localhost:8080/form

Input localhost:8080/form.html in a browser, enter your name and email address, and click submit. It will redirect you to localhost:8080/form with the details you just entered.

This is a basic tutorial in my journey to become better at Go.
